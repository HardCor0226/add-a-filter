# add-a-filter

This program generates a very basic webpage with the purpose of uploading an image file which can then have a few different visual filters applied to it.
I wrote this program while taking a JavaScript certification course from Duke University in 2020. This was my very first web app development attempt and I like to keep
it around to remind me how far I have come.
